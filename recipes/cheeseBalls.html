    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="desc">This cheese ball recipe is perfect if you want to get ahead before the holiday panic sets in and freeze these cheese balls to give as gifts to family and friends. They're so good, the requests will never stop. To give them as gifts, just thaw overnight in the refrigerator, roll in a mixture of parsley and pecans, and rewrap each ball or log individually in festive holiday plastic wrap.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Cheese</strong> - A mix of both mozzarella and cheddar cheese gives it the ideal combination of a stringy texture and a creamy flavour. Make sure to use shredded cheese, or cheese cubes cut into tiny pieces as it's easier to combine with the rest of the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Veggies</strong> - Potato is the star ingredient here! It helps bind the rest of the ingredients together, also blending perfectly with the mozzarella and cheddar, making it the ideal texture to 'bite into'. Crunchy coloured bell peppers - diced and chopped into small cubes, and some sweet corn for more flavour.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasoning</strong> - Chillies, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and of course loads of garlic for that extra yum factor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Binding Agents</strong> - Cornflour & all-purpose flour to make a slurry that helps with the bread-crumb coating, thus retaining the shape of the cheese ball.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Breadcrumbs</strong> - You could choose to run leftover bread in the food processor, or pick a packet off a shelf. Breadcrumbs do two things crumbing and make these crispy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, add cheddar and mozzarella, grated potato, bell pepper, corn, garlic and the seasoning.</li>
        <li>Mix it all up, and combine all the ingredients. Make sure to do this well enough, so it’s evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Now shape the dough into lime sized balls. Use roughly 2 tbsps of the mix per cheese ball. To ensure they’re of the same size, you could choose to use a measuring scoop or an ice cream scoop too.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile make the flour slurry by combining equal parts of all-purpose flour and cornflour with water, and a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Nicely whisk the mixture, and make sure there are no lumps.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, add breadcrumbs and salt. You could also throw in some extra seasoning (chilli flakes or oregano), for added flavour.</li>
        <li>Mix well.</li>
        <li>Coat the cheese ball with breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Make sure it’s coated uniformly and press it gently on all sides to make sure the breadcrumbs are sticking to the cheeseball.</li>
        <li>Now, dip the ball in the slurry, and coat on all sides.</li>
        <li>Coat with breadcrumbs again, for double crumbing. This will help retain the shape of the cheese ball while frying. Repeat for all the balls. Once done, refrigerate the cheeseballs for around 20 minutes, as it helps hold their shape better.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a kadai. You want the oil to be between 350 F – 375 F. Slide a few cheeseballs into the hot oil.</li>
        <li>Deep fry until the outside turns crisp and golden brown. This should take about 2-3 minutes. Once done, scoop them out with a ladle, and place them on a tissue, to soak up the excess oil.</li>
        <li>This is an extra step which is optional but highly recommended – toss them in some peri peri or a spicy seasoning of your choice. Dig in while they are still hot!</li>
    </ol>
